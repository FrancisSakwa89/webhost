                <hr>
                <p>Considering that people are often faced by time and resource consuming processes to find a
                  suitable/desired healthcare practitioner. i.e relying on references from friends and family; making
                  countless calls and visits to multiple hospitals.
                  <br>
                  A team of five decided to innovate myDaktari as avenue by which patients can be united to healthcare
                  professionals, particularly specialty medics.
                  <br><br>
                  WEBHOST is an app created by a team of five students from Moringa school who include:
                  <br>
                  <br>Cynthia Muriithi
                  <br>Elias Kanoga
                  <br>Francis Sakwa
                  <br>Vynnel Omondi
                  <br>
                  Came together while at Moringa School to conceptualize this pivotal healthcare innovation.
                  <br>
                  It is our hope that millions of Kenya benefit from the service, patients and healthcare practitioners
                  alike.
